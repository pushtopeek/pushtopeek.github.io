# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Push-to-Peek we have a few fundamental principles:

 - We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

 - We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

 - We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

Push-to-Peek Inc. ("Push-to-Peek") operates several websites including pushtopeek.com. It is Push-to-Peek's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Push-to-Peek collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Push-to-Peek's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Push-to-Peek's visitors use its website.
From time to time, Push-to-Peek may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Push-to-Peek also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.
Push-to-Peek only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Push-to-Peek's websites choose to interact with Push-to-Peek in ways that require Push-to-Peek to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Push-to-Peek gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
Push-to-Peek does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Aggregated Statistics
Push-to-Peek may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
Push-to-Peek may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Push-to-Peek does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Push-to-Peek discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
(i) need to know that information in order to process it on Push-to-Peek's behalf or to provide services available at Push-to-Peek's websites, and
(ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Push-to-Peek's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Push-to-Peek will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Push-to-Peek discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Push-to-Peek believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Push-to-Peek, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of a Push-to-Peek website and have supplied your email address, Push-to-Peek may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Push-to-Peek and our products.
We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
Push-to-Peek takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Business Transfers
If Push-to-Peek, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Push-to-Peek goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Push-to-Peek may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Push-to-Peek and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
